# SousTech Update 4
#### Zachary Wade &lt;zwade&gt;

## Major Changes

Some large changes are planned as a result of the work done so far. See below for more detail.

## Accomplishments

The majority of the past two weeks of class were spent tuning the sensors and collecting data from a wide array of sources. Examples of the data collected include 

 - Boiling Water
 - Tomato Sauce
 - Bell Pepper
 - Black Tea

In addition, some rudimentary data analysis was performed. Unfortunately, the results gathered raised some rather large concerns about repeatability. The data demonstrate no obvious correlation between observed gas and the food being cooked. Thus, toward the end of these weeks I began planning an alternative solution based around using the surface temperature of the dish acting as a baseline. In addition, I will add a method for recording anomolies during collection

## Milestone

I completed the milestone I set forth, namely I finished calibrating the sensors and I collected significant amounts of data. 

## Suprises

The large surprise was that one mentioned above, in that the data seems uncorrelated with the food being cooked.

## Looking Ahead

For the next few weeks, I will be integrating the new sensor into my pipeline and recalibrating the data collection using it.

## Revisions

My new milestone is to add the temperature baseline into the pipeline, as well as some rudimentary logging to be correlated with the collection. Once this is complete, I will need to recollect a lot of data.

## Resources

All further resources have been acquired.
