# SousTech Update 1
#### Zachary Wade &lt;zwade&gt;

## Major Changes

No major changes have occured yet.

## Accomplishments

Since the start of the semester, I have picked up work from the last semester, and have addressed hardware faults that had kept us from gathering robust data. Through a careful resolder of several components, in addition to thorough testing of each sensor and the board itself, I have updated the prototype to be fully functional with no evident errors. In addition to being functional, the hardware improvements have rendered the device more robust, and thus less likely to experience any further issues.

## Milestone

Finishing any hardware components was the main goal of this milestone. I have succeeded in this regard, although it is at this point that plans and reality begin to diverge. Instead of, as my plan suggested, looking forward to other hardware additions to the device, I will be refocusing my attention on the hardware that I have. As part of this, I will need to develop a stronger enclosure, meaningful and repeatable tests, and from there determine the future of the hardware.  In this manner, I have been focusing my attentions on the development of the new chassis. 

## Suprises

No major surprises have arisen.

## Looking Ahead

My goal is to have a sturdy prototype within the next two weeks, and a plan for how I will gather data and perform regressions on them. Once this data has been collected, I will need to examine it and attempt feature extraction before I can progress further.

## Revisions

Although my milestone does require some change, the general gist remains the same. As I move forward, I hope to have a more robust device with hardware integrated well, in addition to a regression model that can help determine the feasibility of using these sensors in their intended manner.

## Resources

No further resources are needed at this time
