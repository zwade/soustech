# SousTech Update 6
#### Zachary Wade &lt;zwade&gt;

## Major Changes

No major changes have occurred.

## Accomplishments

The past two weeks have been largely focused on data acquisition and performance improvements. Specifically, a few minor hardware bugs were fixed leading to improved performance, and an attempt was made to increase ventilation in the device. In terms of data acquisition, further experiments were performed to determine the data acquired by non-steam releasing foods as well as to examine signals related to burning. 

## Milestone

Unfortunately, despite the additional testing equipment and tests, I was unable to determine a stable (and repeatable) method for classifying the food. A large battery of tests showed us that the "signal" we were receiving was actually the result of human intervention &mdash; i.e. actions such as stirring or flipping were causing the data we saw. This is not wholly surprising, however it is unforunate as it means that we still have no concrete method for determining the type of food being cooked. With that said however, we can reliably detect when a human is interacting with food, and when the food is beginning to burn. These may both be useful in their own right.

## Suprises

The biggest surprise was related to how hot the device gets. With the new ambient temperature sensor installed, we found that the device would heat to about 120&deg;F before the arduino shut itself off. We have no clear solution for this right now. 

## Looking Ahead

The remainder of the work will be on improving data acquisition and gathering more varied sets of data in order to determine what eelse we can detect.

## Revisions

At this point the main goal is to continue collecting data and determining the feasibility of detection.

## Resources

More food is required for testing purposes.
